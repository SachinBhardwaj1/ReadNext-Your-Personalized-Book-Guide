# ReadNext - Your Personalized Book Guide

The model objective is to offer customers personalised book recommendations. It accomplishes this through analyzing user-rated books and finding other users who share its preferences. The model makes recommendations for books that the user hasn't read but is probably going to like by taking advantage of these similarities. User-based collaborative filtering is a technique that makes the assumption that users who have similar preferences in the past will also have similar preferences in the future.
