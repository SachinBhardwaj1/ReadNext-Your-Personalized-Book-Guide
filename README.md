## 🔍 How the Model Works  

1️⃣ **Loading the Data**  
- 📂 **Ratings Dataset (`Ratings.csv`)** – Contains user ratings for books.  
- 📂 **Books Dataset (`Books.csv`)** – Includes book titles and ISBNs.  

2️⃣ **Building a User-Item Matrix**  
- **Rows** → Users (`User_ID`)  
- **Columns** → Books (`ISBN`)  
- **Cells** → Ratings (Unrated books are treated as zero)  

3️⃣ **Finding Similar Users 👥**  
- Uses **Cosine Similarity** to compare user preferences.  
- Identifies **Top 10 most similar users** for each reader.  

4️⃣ **Scoring & Selecting Books 🎯**  
- Books are scored using **weighted ratings from similar users**.  
- Higher scores = **Higher chance of being recommended**.  

5️⃣ **Generating Top 5 Personalized Picks 📖**  
- Only books **not yet rated** by the user are considered.  
- Titles are mapped using `Books.csv` for easy readability.
